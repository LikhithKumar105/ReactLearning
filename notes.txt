- Its a js library, not framework.
- React is a set of re usable components, which help to build web applications.
- JSX- JavaScript XML.
- React uses a virtual DOM(light weight version of real DOM).
- We can re render only the changed components instead of whole web application which reduces time and load.
- prerequisites - js, html.
- CSS
    - External - Good for global styles or small projects.
    - Modules - Preferred for individual components which have their unique styles.
    - Inline- Good for small components with minimal styling.
- The `useState()` hook allows managing state in functional components.
- The `useEffect()` hook is used for side effects like fetching data, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
- `useCallback()` memoizes a function, preventing unnecessary re-creation.
